        <p> At the age of about ten years old,  New York Times photographer Michelle Agins, stood outside with her grandmother, waiting for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to come to her neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago. Wearing her grandfather's cap with a sign on it that read: P-R-E-G, her interpretation of “press,” she caught the eye of a professional photographer working the event. He asked Agins if she worked for a publication. </p>

<p>"I don't work for a paper yet, but I will," she said. </p>

        <p> Suddenly, he placed her in front of Dr. King who had just gotten out of his car. Dr. King greeted her, and Agins froze with her camera in hand. White yelled at her to take the photo and she did,  her hands trembling. "I remember seeing that little shaky photograph. I used to have it for the longest somewhere, somewhere in my house,” says Agins, now 68. “You know, after that day. I knew." 
        </p>

        <p>  She was right. Over the past nearly 30 years Michelle Agins, has become respected in her field, the second Black photographer the New York Times hired at a time when photo editors still hired very few women. </p>

        <p> Over her career, she has won a Gordon Parks Award, Mayor's Award for Photographic Excellence, two Pulitzer Prize nominations, a Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for The New York Times series "How Race is Lived in America," and more.
        </p>

   <p> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cayo3HIMt9u/">Women photograph,</a> a non-profit organization dedicated to elevating nonbinary and women visual journalists' voices, analyzed the number of women photographers hired from 2017 to 2022 by major publications. The study showed that the number of women who have led photo byline on the front pages of newspapers will not be equal to the number of men until 2057 at the current pace newspapers hire women photographers. </p>

   <p>Even in 1986, media outlets were asking “ where are all the black women photojournalists?” says Aigns. “There ain't that many, you know, ain't that many,” she says. </p>

   <p>In seventh grade, Aigns starting to change that narrative without knowing it.  She saw a posting for her school's photo club in seventh grade. When she went to sign up for the club, her teacher, Mr. English told her only boys could join the club. 
</p>

<p>“So I went, I told my grandmother,” Agins says, “Bad idea for that poor teacher. So She came up the next week cuz she's a member of the Parent Teachers Association. She said she wanted to see who this teacher was. And so she met Ms. English. She said, why, in her Jamaican [accent] why you not let my grandchild, my granddaughter, be in this club.”
</p>

<p>Agins says her grandmother told Mr. English that “[Michelle] is very good. She can teach you how to take photos.” 
</p>

<p>Mr. English insisted Michelle come back and join the photo club.</p>

            <h3> Agins took this photo for her series on life in Harlem in 1994. “I had to hang out in order for the folks in the community to accept me and to start getting used to me,” Agins said.</h3>

<p>After graduating from Rosary College (Dominican University) in 1977, taking a job as a copy girl for the Chicago Daily News while attending Loyola University Chicago between 1971 to 1972, and having an impressive portfolio, she could not find a job after graduation. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>"So, I went to [Michael Anthony Bilandic], which is our city council[man] in Chicago. And I told him I'd like a job," says Michelle. "He said, well, what job do you want?"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> "I would like to be the photographer for the mayor of Chicago," she says she told him. </p>


<p>Six years later, Agins would have a job as a photographer for Harold Washington, the first Black Mayor of Chicago. </p>

<p>After four years with Mayor Washington, in 1987 she  left Chicago, for The Charlotte Observer. The photo chief was unaware that his paper had hired its first Black woman photographer. </p>

<p>A few weeks into the job, the photo chief sent Michelle to Gastonia, North Carolina to photograph what she thought was a choir, but when she got closer, saw hoods. </p>

<p>“I saw the church that I was supposed to go into, and I saw the people going into the door where they told me to go into. Right.” Agins says as she describes her encounter with the Klan. “I thought it was the choir because they all had their rope that looked like plastic bags, you know? So I had no idea. So I walked into the church. And I went oh, shoot. It was, was the Klan it was a Klan meeting.”</p>

<p>“So then the guy, the PR guy  said, “Uh, can we help you?” I said, “I'm from the Charlotte Observer.” [He] said “Did they tell you?” I said “yeah, this is, this is the address, right? This is the church. Right. He said “somebody is really playing a horrible joke on you, and she told him “nope, I figured that this is something like this.”</p>

<p>Agins says her Buddhist religion helps keep her at peace. </p>

<p>“In 1986, I started chanting… I met some people who were Buddhist and they said anything you wanna be, chat about. So I started chanting and sure enough things started to happen, you know? I've been a Buddhist now, 35 years, you know? And  it really helped me. Whenever I have situations it's really helped me stay focused and centered and not to be defeated,” says Agins.</p>

<p>In 1989, Agins focus brought her to The New York Times, where she has worked for 32 years. James Estrin, also a New York Times photographer whom Agins has saved as “Rabbi James Estrin” on her phone, has worked with Michelle for 30 years. He admires her ability to connect with subjects. "Almost everyone [Michelle] photographs becomes her friend seriously,” says Estrin. “Like literally. She just has this way with people that is unparalleled."</p>

<p>For Black women like Aigns staying the course often comes with the feelings of self-doubt and the pressure of having to be  ten times better than everyone else in the room. </p>

<p>"I stayed the course, but sometimes I feel like because I had to fight so long, you know, to stay the course that I really just missed the whole point of me being a photojournalist," says Michelle.</p>

<p> “I've gotten some great pictures, I know there's a lot more I could have gotten if I had been a little bit more relaxed and you know, not so, you know, overthinking things because of worrying about, you know, oh, is she gonna make it, is she gonna make this right picture?"</p>
